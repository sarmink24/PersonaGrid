# PersonaGrid

## What is this?
PersonaGrid is a tool that helps you create "virtual marketing teams." Imagine having a group of digital assistants who can act like real people on social media—posting, liking, and commenting for you. You can create different "Personas" (like a "Tech Expert" or a "Friendly Helper"), and this tool helps them do their job automatically.

## What's Done So Far?
We have built the core foundation of the app. Here is what is ready:

*   **🏢 Organization Hub:** You can create different workspaces for different companies or agencies.
*   **🤖 Virtual Personas:** You can create AI characters, give them names, and define their personalities.
*   **🧠 Smart AI Commands:** We have "Global AI Users" that act as super-assistants to help generate content for everyone.
*   **👑 Admin Dashboard:** A powerful control panel for the main administrator to manage all users and settings.
*   **🔒 Secure Login:** A fully working login and signup system, including a "Forgot Password" feature if you get locked out.

## How to Install & Run

Follow these simple steps to get it running on your computer.

### 1. Get the Code
Download this folder or clone it using Git:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd PersonaGrid
```

### 2. Install the Tools
You need to install the software packages for both the "Server" (Backend) and the "Client" (Frontend).
```bash
# Install Server tools
cd server
npm install

# Install Client tools
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Settings
We need to set up some secret keys (like database passwords).
*   **Server:** Copy the file `server/env.example` to a new file named `server/.env`. Fill in your details inside it.
*   **Client:** Copy the file `client/env.example` to a new file named `client/.env`.

### 4. Start the Database
Make sure you have **Docker** installed and running. Then run:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Then, set up the database tables:
```bash
cd server
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run prisma:seed
```

### 5. Run the App!
You need to open **two terminal windows**.

**In the first terminal (Server):**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

**In the second terminal (Client):**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

That's it! Open your browser to the link shown in the Client terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Demo Login Credentials

### Organization (Mosaic Digital Agency)

| Field    | Value              |
|----------|--------------------|
| Email    | `mosaic@demo.com`  |
| Password | `demo123456`       |

To seed this demo org with 20 diverse AI personas:
```bash
cd server
npm run seed:personas
```

This creates **Mosaic Digital Agency** with 20 wildly different personas (sports hype beast, dry academic, wellness guru, hacker meme lord, corporate PR director, EDM promoter, grandma, fitness coach, kids' creator, nihilist, fashion critic, survivalist, science debunker, activist poet, crypto bro, sad poet, dad joke machine, gothic influencer, zen food curator, glitch artist) across Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

### Admin

Admin credentials are configured via environment variables in your `.env` file:
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` - your admin email
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - your admin password (min 12 characters)

Then seed with:
```bash
cd server
npm run prisma:seed-admin
```

## 🚀 What's Next?
We are working hard to make this even better! Here is what is coming soon:

*   **🔗 Real Connections:** Soon, your personas will be able to connect to **real** Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and Facebook accounts to post for you.
*   **✈️ Auto-Pilot Mode:** You won't even need to click "Post." You can set a schedule, and the AI will generate and post content automatically while you sleep.
*   **📈 Performance Reports:** See how many likes, views, and comments your AI team is getting with simple charts.
*   **🧠 Better Brains:** We are upgrading the AI to remember past conversations and have even more unique personalities.
